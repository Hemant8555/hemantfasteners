        <p class="lead-p"><strong>Fastener </strong>are universal components used to create non-permanent joints between two or more objects, these joints can be dismantled without damaging the objects/components.<br><br>There are generally two type of joints:<br><strong>Permanent Joints: </strong>Joints that cannot be removed/dismantled like welded joints. If removed forcely, there are heavy chances of damaging components.<br><strong>Temporary Joints:</strong> Joints that can be removed as per our choice like screws in electronic devices. Eg. We can disassemble mobile phone using screwdriver.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Fasteners falls into this category.</span></p>

        <p>Objects can be joined using different objects like rope,wire or cable but they do not count into fasteners because they have more additional uses, but the fasteners have only use of connecting objects rigidly and mechanically.<br><br>Fasteners comes in different shapes,sizes,quality and material. So you should understand about different types of fasteners and their uses, so you can chhode appropriate fastener for your project.<br><br></p>

        <h3><strong>Types of fasteners:</strong><strong><br></strong></h3>
        <p>The most common types are the<strong> screw, nut and bolt</strong>, possibly involving washers. Other more specialized types of threaded fasteners include captive threaded fasteners, stud, threaded inserts, and threaded rods.</p>

          </ul>and many more
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Nuts:</h3>
        <p>A nut is a fastener that consists of a block with a threaded hole in the centre. The hole contains ‘female’ threads that typically correspond to the ‘male’ threads of a bolt or screw. Nuts are used with their ‘mating’ bolt or screw to fasten materials together.
<br>The most common shape for a nut is hexagonal, as six sides provide more angles for a tool to approach from, although the corners can be more vulnerable to becoming rounded off over time which makes them less easy to use with tools. Square nuts can also be used but are less common.<br><br>Nuts are used for many different applications and so there are a wide variety of different types. Some of these include:
<br>
<br><strong><em>Basic hex nut:</em></strong> A six-sided nut, and the most common type. There are several variations such as the nylon insert lock which helps secure the nut in place.
<br><em><strong>Wing nut</strong></em>: The head of a wing nut has two ‘wings’ on each side, enabling it to be tightened and loosened by hand.Mainly used for temporary fastening.
<br><strong><em>Cap nut: </em></strong>This type of nut is closed at one end with a smooth-domed top.
<br><em><strong>Acorn nut:</strong></em> Similar to a cap nut but the rounded end has a higher crown.
<br><em><strong>Barrel nut:</strong></em> Also known as a dowel nut, this has a round ‘slug’ with threads perpendicular to its length.
<br><em><strong>Cage nut:</strong></em> A spring steel cage wraps around the nut with wings that can be used to compress and release the nut.
<br><em><strong>Coupling nut:</strong></em> A threaded fastener for joining two male threads together, such as in pipework, or to make long rod assemblies from shorter lengths.
<br><em><strong>Flange nut:</strong></em> A wide flange at one end acts as an integrated washer, distributing the pressure of the nut over the part being secured.
<br><em><strong>Insert nut:</strong></em> Inserted into a pre-drilled hole to provide a threaded socket.
<br><em><strong>Split nut:</strong></em> Split into two pieces to allow the female thread to open and close over the male thread of a bolt or screw.
<br><em><strong>Square nut:</strong></em> A four-sided nut which provides greater resistance to loosening.
<br><em><strong>Swage nut: </strong></em>Also known as a self-clinching nut, this is used to permanently anchor itself onto sheet metal.
<br><em><strong>T-nut:</strong></em> A long, thin body with a T-shaped flange at one end which digs in, leaving a flush surface.
<br><em><strong>Weld nut:</strong></em> A specialised nut that can be welded to another component.<br><br><br><br></p>
        <h3>Bolts:</h3>
        <p>Bolts are headed, externally threaded fasteners used to keep two objects, often metal or wood, in a fixed position relative to one another. Unlike screws, which cut their own threads, bolts pair with the internal threads of nuts to stay in place and ensure the desired level of tension in the bolted joint. The use of nuts aids in disassembly and reassembly. In addition, bolts generally have a greater load bearing capacity than screws but lack a tapered shaft. The head style of the bolt determines the tool required for tightening and loosening. Bolts are responsible for holding together everything from furniture to machinery to bridges.
          <br><br><strong>The principal types of bolts commonly used include:</strong><br>There are many different varieties of bolt which can be selected based on the particular requirement or the materials involved. Some of the most common types include:
<br>
<br><em><strong>Anchor bolt:</strong></em> Usually embedded in concrete or masonry for structural applications.
<br><em><strong>Carriage bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Used to fasten metal to timber, with a squared undercut to the head which holds the bolt in place once it has been tightened.
<br><em><strong>Elevator bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Commonly used in conveyor systems, an elevator bolt has a flat, plain or countersunk head which holds the bolt in place when tightened.
<br><em><strong>Flange bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Also known as frame bolts, this type of bolt distributes the bearing load using a washer on the undercut of the head.
<br><em><strong>Hanger bolt:&nbsp;</strong></em>This type of bolt comprises two threaded ends instead of having a head, one of which contains a wood screw.
<br><em><strong>Hexagon bolt/Tap bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;A hexagon bolt comprises a head that has six sides, with threading that begins part-way down the shank, whereas a tap bolt’s shank is threaded the whole length.
<br><em><strong>Huck bolt:&nbsp;</strong></em>A proprietary bolt in which the pin and collar are swaged together using a specialist tool to form a permanent fixing.
<br><em><strong>Lag bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Also known as lag screws, this is a heavy-duty fastener that creates its own mating thread in timber and other soft materials when tightened.
<br><em><strong>Machine bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;This type of bolt has a short shank and is intended for assembling metal components through predrilled holes.
<br><em><strong>Plow bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;This type of bolt is commonly used in construction tools and other devices due to its durability, and is characterised by its flat countersunk head and square shank neck.
<br><em><strong>Sex bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Rather than requiring a nut, the shank of sex bolts are covered with a ‘mating’ female component. These are useful for fastening components that cannot be exposed to abrasive threads.
<br><em><strong>Square head bolt:&nbsp;</strong></em>This is similar to a machine bolt in that it has a short shank, in addition to a four-sided bolt head.
<br><em><strong>Stud bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;This type of bolt has hexagon nuts on both ends. Components are fastened between the two bolts.
<br><em><strong>Timber bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Bolts that are meant for use with large timber components.
<br><em><strong>T-head bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Has a T-shaped head which can be gripped by a wench and can fit into a slot with ease.
<br><em><strong>Toggle bolt: </strong></em>This type of bolt has an expanding wing-like nut which helps it to mount objects to walls.
<br><em><strong>U-bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;Similar to staples, U-bolts are bent in the shape of a ‘U’ and are partially threaded on both ends.<br><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>
</p>
<br>
        <h3>Screws:</h3>
        <p>A screw and a bolt are similar types of fastener typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread). Screws and bolts are used to fasten materials by the engagement of the screw thread with a similar female thread (internal thread) in the matching part.
<br>Screws are often self-threading (also known as self-tapping) where the thread cuts into the material when the screw is turned, creating an internal thread that helps pull fastened materials together and prevent pull-out. There are many screws for a variety of materials; those commonly fastened by screws include wood, sheet metal, and plastic.<br><br><strong>Common types of screws:</strong><br>There are many different varieties of screw which are selected based on the particular requirement or the materials involved. Some of the most common types include:
<br>
<br><em><strong>Wood screw:</strong></em> Typically designed with a partially-unthreaded shank and used to attach pieces of timber together.
<br><em><strong>Concrete screw:</strong></em> Stainless or carbon steel and used for fastening materials to concrete.
<br><em><strong>Masonry screw:</strong></em> Often have a blue coating and are inserted to a pilot hole in masonry.
<br><strong><em>Double-ended (dowel) screw: </em></strong>Have two pointed ends and no head. Often used for making hidden joints between two pieces of timber.
<br><em><strong>Drive screw:</strong></em> Smooth, round or mushroom-headed with a reduced diameter shank.
<br><em><strong>Drywall screw:</strong></em> Often coated with black phosphate and designed with a bugle head. Used to attach drywall to timber or metal studs.
<br><em><strong>Eye bolt:</strong></em>&nbsp;A looped head designed to be used as an attachment point. Also used for attaching wires across building surfaces.
<br><em><strong>Decking screw:</strong></em> Longer screws which are used for fastening down deck boards.
<br><em><strong>Lag screw/bolt</strong></em>:&nbsp;A heavy-duty fastener.
<br><em><strong>Chipboard screw:</strong></em>&nbsp;Often wax-coated and used for fastening down chipboard flooring.
<br><em><strong>Mirror screw:</strong></em>&nbsp;Designed with a decorative dome or other cover to conceal the head.
<br><em><strong>Twinfast screw:</strong></em>&nbsp;Designed with two threads which enable it to driven twice as fast.
<br><em><strong>Security head screw:</strong></em> Designed with a head that is impossible to reverse, making it suitable for security applications.<br><br><br><strong><br></strong></p>
        
        <h3>Washers:</h3>
        <p>Washers are disk-shaped components that provide enhanced control over locking and friction when used with other fasteners. These fasteners may also feature teeth, indentations, and other unique structural mechanisms for use in more specialized applications. In general, they serve a variety of functions, including preventing loosening of the fastener assembly, protecting the surface under a fastener, and distributing the pressure more evenly during installation and use.</p>

       <p><strong>There are three main categories of washer:
<br></strong>
<br><strong>1. Plain washers: </strong>Also known as a flat washer, this type of washer is a flat annulus or ring which is used to spread the load of a screwed fastening and prevent damage to the surface being fixed.<br></p><p><strong>Types of plain washer include:
<br></strong><em><strong>Penny washer (or Fender washer): </strong></em>A flat washer with a larger outer diameter proportional to the central hole, i.e it can distribute loads more widely.
<br><strong><em>Spherical washer: </em></strong>Consists of one radiused surface which, when used with a mating nut, allows for several degrees of misalignment between parts.
<br><strong><em>C-washer:</em> </strong>Can be slid in and out of position on a bolt or shaft.
<br><strong><em>Countersunk washer: </em></strong>When secured, this type of washer creates a flush surface.<br></p><br><p><strong>2. Spring washers:&nbsp;</strong>This type of washer has axial flexibility which helps prevent fastening or loosening as a result of vibrations or shock.
<br><br><strong>Types of spring washer include:
</strong><br><strong><em>Belleville washer: </em></strong>Has a slight conical shape which helps maintain tension in assemblies where there is thermal expansion and contraction.
<br><strong><em>Curved disc spring:</em></strong> Is only curved in one direction and so is used to support relatively light loads with a wide deflection range.
<br><strong><em>Wave washer: </em></strong>Has a ‘wave’ in the axial direction which makes it suitable for use as a cushion spring or spacer.
<br><strong><em>Split washer:</em></strong> Has a ring that is split at one point and bent into a helical shape creating more friction and rotation resistance.</p><br><p><br><strong>3. Locking washers:</strong>This type of washer is often interchangeable with spring washers and prevents fastening or loosening rotation.&nbsp;<br></p>
<br><strong>Types of locking washer include:
</strong><br><em><strong>Helical spring: </strong></em>Increases the pre-load on the fastener while tightening. This provides protection against loosening.
<br><em><strong>Toothed lock washer:</strong></em> Has serrations around its edge that can extend inward or outward to bite into the surface material and provide maximum torsional resistance.
<br><em><strong>Tab washer:</strong></em> Has a side tab that can be bent into place against a nut, preventing rotation.
